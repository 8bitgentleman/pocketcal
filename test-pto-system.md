## Expected User Experience

### For Multiple People/Teams:
1. **Each event group represents a person or team**
2. **Independent PTO policies** - each group can have different:
   - Years of service (affects total PTO allowance)
   - Rollover hours from previous year
   - PTO enabled/disabled status
3. **No PTO functionality when disabled** - groups without PTO enabled show no PTO options
4. **Clear visual separation** - PTO settings and dashboard only apply to selected group

### For Multi-Day PTO:
1. **Flexible selection methods**:
   - Single day (default): Just select hours per day
   - Multi-day toggle: Choose duration in days OR specific end date
2. **Clear total hours calculation**: Shows per-day hours × number of days
3. **Easy editing**: Existing multi-day entries populate form correctly

### Solved Problems:
- ✅ **Single-day limitation**: Now supports multi-day PTO requests
- ✅ **Global PTO settings**: Each calendar/group has independent PTO policy
- ✅ **Visual confusion**: Clear separation between groups, PTO only shows for enabled groups
- ✅ **Unnecessary dashboard elements**: Removed "Recent PTO Requests" list
- ✅ **Multi-calendar management**: Each event group functions independently

## Technical Implementation Notes

### New PTOEntry Structure:
```typescript
interface PTOEntry {
  id?: string;
  startDate: string;     // ISO format
  endDate: string;       // ISO format (same as start for single day)
  hoursPerDay: number;   // 2, 4, or 8
  totalHours: number;    // calculated field
  name?: string;
}
```

### Store Actions Updated:
- `setPTOConfig(groupId, config)` - per group
- `addPTOEntry(groupId, entry)` - per group
- `getPTOSummary(groupId)` - per group
- All PTO validation and operations scoped to specific groups

### Backward Compatibility:
- URL serialization handles both old and new formats
- Export functions maintain compatibility with existing workflows
- Single-day PTO requests work exactly as before (just with new internal structure)

---

The multi-calendar PTO system now properly supports:
- **Multiple independent calendars/people** with separate PTO policies
- **Multi-day PTO selection** with flexible duration options  
- **Clean, streamlined interface** without unnecessary elements
- **Clear visual separation** between different groups/calendars
